I'm a PhD candidate at The University of Arizona. I was born in Piacenza, Italy. I earned my bachelor's and master's degrees at Politecnico di Milano in aerospace engineering and space engineering respectively. I developed my master thesis in 2017/2018 within a collaboration between Politecnico di Milano and The University of Arizona where I then started my Ph.D. in System Engineering in 2019. Since summer 2019, I've been working on the NASA mission named Near Earth Objects Surveillance Mission (NEOSM) as part of the Follow-Up working group at The University of Arizona, my main contributions being the development of a Near-Earth Objects and ground segment simulator and an intelligent ranking algorithm needed for decision making related to NEOs follow-up strategies. My research is mainly focused on meta-reinforcement learning for spacecraft guidance applications. More recently, I've been focusing on physics informed neural networks for orbit determination. I've also developed a vision-based simulator to train reinforcement learning agents on 3D environments with optical and lidar simulated sensors, which has been instrumental for the development of most of my recent research.
