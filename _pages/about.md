I'm a PhD student at University of Arizona. I was born in Piacenza, Italy. I earned my bachelor's and master's degrees at Politecnico di Milano in aerospace engineering and space engineering respectively. I developed my master thesis in 2017/2018 within a collaboration between Politecnico di Milano and The University of Arizona where I then started my Ph.D. in System Engineering in 2019. Since summer 2019, I've been working on the NASA mission named Near Earth Objects Surveillance Mission (NEOSM) as part of the Follow-Up working group, my main contribution being the development of a Near-Earth Objects simulator to be used to support and validate a ranking algorithm needed for decision making related to NEOs follow-up strategies. My research is mainly focused on meta-reinforcement learning for spacecraft guidance applications. More lately, I've been focusing also on physics informed neural networks for orbit determination. I've also developed a simulator to train reinforcement learning agents on visual environment with optical and lidar simulated sensors.
